<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
I'm Courtney Majocha. I'm a lifelong resident of Massachusetts, currently residing in Woburn with my husband and my Shih Tzu. I'm a graduate degree candidate in the Digital Media track, and this is my eighth class at Harvard Extension. I've been working at Harvard Law School Office of Communications as part of the online team since January. Most of my time has been spent working on a transition from an existing CMS to Wordpress. I've been creating Wordpress sites for entities not transitioning to the main HLS site.

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
I am taking this course to take my knowledge to the next level. I have quite a bit of experience working on static websites, and I'm comfortable with HTML/CSS, but I want to know how to enhance my sites, and I'm interested to learn more about the LAMP framework. Our developers use Github quite a bit at work, so I'm interested to learn more about this tool as well.

<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
I have very limited experience with programming. I've worked with PHP sites before utilizing the dreamweaver-ftp method, so I'm familiar with the code, but I haven't done much writing. I did take CS50 at Harvard Extension, which was mostly using C, and that did give me a crash course on a lot of the programmning terms and concepts.

<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
I'm working with a Mac.

<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
I'm just excited to learn a lot from this class. A lot of this is unfamiliar to me, but I'm eager to work through the practice steps, read all of the materials and take a proative approach. I like trying to figure things out, and I'll always google, backtrack and try to see if I can diagnose a problem myself, before I just throw my hands up in defeat.
